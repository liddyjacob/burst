## SYNOPSIS

`burst` \[OPTIONS\]

## DESCRIPTION

The program `burst` takes a file and splits it into smaller files using threads. The files are given names in the form file-(fileno).ext. 

## OPTIONS

`-l (Lines)`
: Split file into smaller files with (Lines) lines

`-v`
: Verbose: Status and other information in stderr.

## EXAMPLES


Suppose test.txt is 1200 lines

burst test.txt
: Split test.txt into 500 line files, execept the last file, which will contain the leftover (200 in this case) lines.

burst test.txt -l 250
: Do the same thing as above, except splits into 250 line files and a 200 line file.

## BUGS


If a single line exceeds 4096 bytes, then burst will return an error and fail.
